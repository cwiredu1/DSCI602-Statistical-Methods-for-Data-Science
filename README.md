This course was to provides a solid foundation in basic probability, distribution theory, methods of estimation, hypothesis testing and basics of multivariate analysis for data science and related majors at the graduate level.

Key Focus

• Understand basic probability and statistical concepts and theory

• Identify probability distributions of random variables

• Explain the laws of large numbers and sampling distributions

• Choose and effectively use the relevant inference strategies including the estimation processes
and hypothesis testing

• Apply probability and distribution theories to real world data science problems

• Relate multivariate analysis techniques to data science problems

Main Tool
